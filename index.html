        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p1><span class="font1">Hypertext Markup Language <span class="font2">(HTML)</span></span> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p1> <br> <br>
        <p2>Web browsers receive <span class="font2">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <span class="font2">HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p2> <br> <br>
        <p3 class="fontP3"><span class="font2">HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span class="font2">HTML</span> pages. With <span class="font2">HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <span class="font2">HTML</span> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <span class="font2">HTML</span> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span class="font3">< img /></span> and <span class="font3">< input /></span> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <span class="font3">< p ></span> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <span class="font2">HTML</span> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p3> <br>
        <h3>Markup</h3>
        <p4><span class="font2">HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called <span class="font4">tags (and their attributes)</span>, character-based <span class="font4">data types, character references</span> and <span class="font4">entity references</span>. <span class="font2">HTML</span> tags most commonly come in pairs like <span class="font3">< h1 ></span> and <span class="font3">< /h1 ></span>, although some represent <span class="font4">empty elements</span> and so are unpaired, for example <span class="font3">< img ></span>. The first tag in such a pair is the <span class="font4">start tag</span>, and the second is the <span class="font4">end tag</span> (they are also called <span class="font4">opening tags</span> and <span class="font4">closing tags</span>).</p4>  <br> <br>
        <p5>Another important component is the <span class="font2">HTML</span> <span class="font4">document type declaration</span>, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p5> <br> <br>
        <p6>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p6> <br> <br>
